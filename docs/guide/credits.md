Superstreamer wouldn't be here without the awesome help from others! There are some killer projects out there innovating the video industry step by step. Big thanks for all your amazing work â€” we definitely couldn't have pulled this off without you and a ton of coffee!

- The people behind [HLS.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/), past and present contributors.
- The people behind [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), without y'all, video today would be as real as unicorns.
- The [Shaka Project](https://github.com/shaka-project).
- A special shout to Robert Walch for answering so many of my (stupid) questions.

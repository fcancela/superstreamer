# Process

We'll begin by processing and preparing our video source file (e.g., MP4, MKV, ...), ensuring it's properly formatted and optimized for the next stages of transcoding and packaging.

## Terminology

Before we dive in, let's cover some basic terminology. We'll keep this brief, but if you're eager to learn more about video, check out [howvideo.works](https://howvideo.works/). They provide a great explanation of the video delivery process from source to playback.

- Transcode

  The first step is video transcoding, which converts a video from one format or codec to another, ensuring it works across different devices, browsers, and network conditions. For Superstreamer, this involves transcoding into various tracks, such as 720p or 1080p video, and stereo or surround audio.

- Packaging

  After transcoding, we have different video and audio tracks, but they need to be combined into a single format that can be played smoothly. Video packaging organizes these tracks so the player can easily access and switch between them based on the user's device and internet speed. For Superstreamer, we generate HLS playlists.

- HLS

  HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) is a protocol that splits video into small chunks and delivers them over HTTP. For Superstreamer, we focus exclusively on using HLS for streaming.

## Start a transcode <Badge type="info" text="Step 1" />

To stream an MP4 file to your audience, the process begins with transcoding it into various qualities, potentially adding multiple audio languages or subtitle tracks. To interact with Superstreamer, simply make an API request to get started.

We'll begin by sending a `POST` request to the `/transcode` endpoint of our API. In this request, we'll specify the source files (our available inputs) and define the desired outputs â€” specifically, HD and Full HD video tracks, along with English audio.

```sh
curl -X POST
  "https://api.domain.com/transcode"
```

```json
{
  "input": [
    {
      "type": "video",
      "url": "https://domain.com/video.mp4"
    },
    {
      "type": "audio",
      "url": "https://domain.com/video.mp4",
      "language": "eng"
    }
  ],
  "streams": [
    {
      "type": "video",
      "codec": "h264",
      "height": 1080
    },
    {
      "type": "video",
      "codec": "h264",
      "height": 720
    },
    {
      "type": "audio",
      "codec": "aac",
      "language": "eng"
    }
  ]
}
```

We can check the dashboard app to see the status of the transcoding process. Let's wait a moment until the job shows as green.

Superstreamer has assigned the unique UUID `46169885-f274-43ad-ba59-a746d33304fd` to this asset. Let's check the Storage page on the dashboard to see which files have been produced.

<img class="framed" src="/step1-storage.png" />

Perfect, we now have two separate video tracks in different quality levels and a single audio track in English. That's exactly what we wanted.

## Create a package <Badge type="info" text="Step 2" />

Our video and audio tracks are stored as separate files. Let's package them into an HLS playlist, which players will use to determine what to load and at which resolution.

<img class="schema" src="/schema-package.png" />

We'll send a `POST` request to the `/package` endpoint of our API, and all we'll have to do is provide the assetId returned by our transcode job.

```sh
curl -X POST
  "https://api.domain.com/package"
```

```json
{
  "assetId": "46169885-f274-43ad-ba59-a746d33304fd"
}
```

We'll check the dashboard app to check the status of our transcode job.

<img src="/step2-package.png" style="max-width: 460px;" />

And that's it. We now have an HLS playlist available on our S3 bucket.
